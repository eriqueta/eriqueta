<h4>ABOUT</h4>
<p>Bogotá, a Colombian city with more than eight million inhabitants, is as vast as it is diverse. As time passes, more and more images are registered from all around, including the South American capital. But is there a way to explore other inputs, such as sounds in order to collect memories?
Bogotá Suena is an independent initiative to collect sound registries through social media. By using an existing and popular platform, sound and some context information in which those acoustic registries were gathered will be posted.</p>

<h4>PROCESS </h4>
<p>The process of Bogotá Suena has been a challenge from the beginning, without having any experience on social media channels, and little time available for being a side project, we started shaping the initiative by establishing some rules for every sound entry:
It should be hosted in and popular platform and have a space in all popular platforms
It should be short (not longer than 30 seconds)
It should contain an image in order for the users to connect the sound somehow to media that they are already familiar with
All sounds must be published
Responses should be quick
No money should be spent </p>
 
<h4>LEARNINGS </h4>
<p>Collective creation is something that inspire me and every project, I believe powerful ideas are the ones who can grow by itself. From this experience I believe that decentralized projects are the future.
Although side projects are a need in my creative process, very complicated initiatives can be hindering and frustrating, it is very important to consider those aspects as challenges in the ideation process</p>
 
<h4>EXPERIMENTS</h4>

<p>By gathering feedback from users, two main aspects were highlighted and consequently prototyped, they were related to the quality of images and the geolocation, because of those, two experiments were conducted
Instagram: Although the pictures connect to the memories of the users somehow, we realised that capturing both the picture and the sound can be a complicated process. Generally also, it takes a lot of effort to capture a good picture and the quality we ended up receiving was not ideal for the project. For this reason, some experiments were conducted in order to fulfill the need of having a visual aspect on the blog. This will also opening new opportunities of collaboration </p>
 
 
<p>CartoDB: In order to answer to the feedback given by the visitors, we decided to  conduct some geolocation experiments </p>
 
 
<h4>FUTURE CHALLENGES</h4>
<p>Sustainability: How can the project exist an keep on growing without  a curator?
Making it analog: How can the project exist outside virtual spaces? are there possibilities in new technologies as 3d printing to expand the project beyond digital media?</p>
