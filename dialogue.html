<h4>ABOUT</h4>
<p>250 years ago Sweden was the first country to include the right for freedom of press on its constitution. As a way of celebrating this moment in history, The Swedish Institute proposed to Hyper Island the challenge of creating a campaign that will showcase the country as a promoter of the freedom of speech right for both its territory and other countries.</p>

<h4>SOLUTION</h4>
<p>We proposed a  platform that supports a virtual chain of dialogues in which every participant answers a free question from the last participant and asks a question to the next one.
The idea of the platform is to celebrate freedom of speech based on the concept that the best indicator of free expression is not only the ability to say anything but also the possibility of being heard.</p>

<h4>NOTES ABOUT THE PROCESS </h4>
<h4>UNDERSTANDING THE BRIEF </h4>

<p>A debriefing and quick ideation workshop was conducted with the team of the Swedish Institute. The purpose of this workshop was to identify assumptions from both their team and ours and also to align expectations and identify our future challenges.</p>
 
<h4>RESEARCH</h4>
<p>We conducted the process of research in three different stages:
Stage 1 - Learning from experience: We started by researching successful projects delivered by other teams from Swedish Institute and getting insights from previous experiences.
Stage 2 - Inspiration: Researching successful viral projects in  areas such as fine arts, fashion and advertisement; both digital and analog examples were  considered
Stage 3 - Expert interview: Interview with Colombian ex-director of the Foundation for the freedom of press. </h4>
